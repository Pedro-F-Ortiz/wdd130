    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We want to get the attention of adventurous people who like the outdoors and don't mind some fun in the water. The age will most likely be teens to middle aged people and couples looking for new things to try during their vacation trips to this side of the states. As the site is built, it is important to keep in mind the outdoor enthusiast and adventurous type of people who are always looking for a new adventure. Considering the nature of the site, I would expect spring colors that are inviting yet some colors that draw attention to our purpose of adventure. </p>
