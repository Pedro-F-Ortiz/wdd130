            Hello, my name is Pedro Ortiz and I was born in San Luis Potosi, Rio Verde, Mexico but moved to the states when I was 8 and have lived in Conroe, TX since. I am a Junior in college and a little over a year I decided to switch my major over to software engineer but since I was taking classes back home and working fulltime, it only allowed me to take 1,2 classes at a time. Two semesters back, my wife, year and a half old son and I decided to pack up our things and return full time to school since I switched majors and knew I had a long road ahead.

            I love Idaho and all the outdoor things there are to do around here. In my spare time I enjoy a nice peacfull evening fishing, camping and shooting. Since being in Idaho, I have not had a chance to do these hobbies since I moved back to Idaho so if anyone knows of a good place to go fishing around. Let me know. Something I hope to lear is Fly fishing so I hope to be ready this semester to get some practice in. The one thing I love about Idaho is the views when you take a drive throught the national parks and the wildlife just roamming around.
