      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose for this site plan is to prepare a web page that shows my professional portfolio so that I can show my employer and future job interviews. I have learned that in the tech world, what says a lot is what you have been doing with your time outside of school. So, my plan is to have an online portfolio where I will be able to upload my most current resume and store previous ones, my web site projects and present projects I am working on. In a past interview, I was asked to what projects I had and all I could do is tell but this will allow me to show them what I do with my spare time. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is going to be my future employer and future companies that I will be interviewing with while exploring my career options. The intent is to have an actual project that I can present with my computer during interviews when asked about what projects have, I done. This will allow me to have a more tech driven job interview. It will also help me keep track of my web site projects and code I am working on all saved in one place. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My site will consist of an “About me” section that will be focused on my life and how I came to be a software engineer. I will add details about my family and what I like to do in my personal time like fishing, camping, shooting guns and site seeing. This will help paint a mental picture of who I am outside of work during my interview with the hopes of sparking up conversation that will be an ice breaker during the interview. Information that my portfolio will need is a header, body, and footer. Within the header you will see a logo, quote and buttons that will jump you to certain sections of my page like a resume button that will bring up my current resume in pdf form. The about me, projects, and contact me section. The body will contain the About me, and projects section and the footer will contain my contact information like social medial links, trademark, and contact information. I really want my audience to have an image of me before the interview so that I can catch their attention prior to showing up. Considering that this is my first portfolio, it will be very basic, but my hopes is that by the time I graduate I have revised it a lot more and have added more detail to it.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        My personal site is about my portfolio so the purpose of this site is to have an electronic site that I can pull out during an interview and show my current employer when asked what I do with my spare time. Most people will not be going to my site unless I am interviewing for a job since I will post the link to my page on my resume and for those moments where I ask for peer reviews of my page. But it will be a great way to demonstrate my hobbies and what I have done instead of boring people with explanations of my project. The other thing I aim to accomplish with my site is to start conversations about programming during or after they viewed my projects, so they are aware of the coding languages I know how to program in. Considering that this is my first portfolio, it will be very basic, but my hopes is that by the time I graduate I have revised it a lot more and have added more detail to it. This will be my personal graduation project that I hope to be able to present to my employer when seeking switching departments and as always, keeping my options open. I will be planning to interview with other companies the closer I get to graduation.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        My wireframe is based on my professional experience portfolio. After talking to Sister Anderson we agreed that instead of creating a page 2,3 since most portfolios are a scroll down page. She said that I could substitute pages with jump to sections. The home section will include a picture, quote, and buttons that will jump you into the sections that are substituting page 2,3. 
      </p>

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        The substitution for page 2 will consist of an about me section. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/wireframe_page2.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        The substitute for page 3 will include a section with my projects but considering that I am new and don't have much experience the links will not take you anywhere. The goal is beyond this semester so I hope to edit my portfolio during the next semesters with side projects and examples to actually show during job interviews. At the bottom of the page 3 will be the header section with a contact me info and social media links.
