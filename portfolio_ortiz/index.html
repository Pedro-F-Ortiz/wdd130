                    <h2>About me:</h2>
                    <p>My name is Pedro Felipe Ortiz Baez, and I was born in Rio Verde, San Luis Potosi, Mexico and moved to the states when I was only 8 years old. I grew up speaking Spanish, but I consider English my primary language since I speak it the most. I come from a family of twelve siblings total that include an even number of six sisters and six brothers with me being eleventh of the twelve siblings. I have always considered higher education to be the path I wanted to take but growing up I was not taught that education was the path to take but that I was a man and had to get a job and provide for my family. This concept changed after serving a two-year church mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints where I was surrounded by great church leaders and examples that showed me the importance for me to get a college education. As a full time, missionary, we are assigned a mission leader whose title is that of a mission president. I served under President James R. Gee who happened to be one of the prior councilors to the now Elder David A. Bednar who was the dean of Brigham Young University- Idaho. It was President Gee that helped me get into Brigham Young University- Idaho and to get established here in Idaho after moving from Texas where all my immediate family lives. In the process of getting an education and having to move back to Texas temporarily, I started at an ERP software company called Global Shop Solutions Inc. located in The Woodlands, Tx and where I was introduced into programming and what started me on this journey to challenge and learn something new. Although I am fairly new to programming, don’t let that distract you from my strong work ethics that have enriched me with many great opportunities to work for great companies and in various roles that were quickly rewarded by pay increases, bonus, and promotions. I am currently a Junior at Brigham Young University- Idaho pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineer with an emphasis in web design and software programming. I am currently working for Global Shop Solutions Inc. as part of their technical service technician for the last 2 years and will look forward to a more programming/ web development role upon graduating or shortly before graduating.
